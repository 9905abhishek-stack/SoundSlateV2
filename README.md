# 🧠 SoundSlate  
**AI-Powered Insights for Early Learning Intervention**

SoundSlate is an AI-driven platform designed to help **parents and teachers identify early learning difficulties**—such as dyslexia—through a child’s **reading fluency** and **handwriting patterns**.  
The goal is to make early detection **simpler, faster, and more accessible** using real-time AI analysis and personalized insights.

## 🚀 Features

- **Reading Fluency (WPM) Test:** Records and analyzes reading speed and accuracy.  
- **Comprehension & Writing Analysis:** Evaluates comprehension from written samples.  
- **Handwriting Dyslexia Detector API:** Custom-built model that identifies early signs of dyslexia from handwriting images.  
- **AI Content Generator:** Creates adaptive learning material tailored to each child’s needs.  
- **Insight Dashboard:** Visualizes progress and key skill metrics (reading speed, accuracy, vocabulary, comprehension).
